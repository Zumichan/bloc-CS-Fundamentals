1. What is a hash table?

A) A type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a unique key, forming key-value pairs, just like JavaScript objects.

2. What is hashing?

A) It is a process of converting string keys into numerical indices (hash code). We need this hashing process because arrays can only be indexed by numbers.

3. How does a hash table store data?

A) It stores key-value pairs by placing them at a particular location in an array maintained internally in the hash table.

4. How are hash tables and objects different?

A) In case of JavaScript, they are almost the same. Hash tables are a subset of objects. 
If your data is a static number of distinct values of different types, then an object is the optimal choice. You can use a hash table when your data contains a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
-A list of pets and their unique names.
A) Hash Table

-The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.
A) Object

-The name and location of every company in a given city.
A) Hash Table

-All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.
A) Hash Table

-The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.
A) Object

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.



7. Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.


8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.
