#### Exercises

1. What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?

A) Binary tree is a data structure which simulates a hierarchal tree structure where each tree consists of Nodes. Binary tree is unique since it can have only up to child Nodes.

2. What is a heuristic?

A) It is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly or for finding an approximate solution. The objective is to apply a rule of thumb approach to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. There is no guarantee that the solution found will be the most accurate or optimal solution for the given problem.

3. What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?

A) 
Machine Learning: Artificial Intelligence algorithms based on machine learning where the computer builds up a knowledge base from previous experiences is another application of heuristic algorithms. In this case the algorithm uses a self-maintained knowledge base to inform decisions and make “educated guesses” based on previous experiences.

Language Recognition: When analyzing the meaning of a user input, for instance when a user asks a question on a search engine or interacts with a Google Home or Amazon Echo device, an algorithm tries to make sense of the user inputs. Word associations, analysis of context, previous searches history and current trends/search engine statistics can be used in a heuristic algorithm to speed up the search process.

4. What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?

A) 
A Depth-First Search is the process of traveling down a single branch in search of the desired element. If you you can't find the element, move upwards and repeat the process with unvisited Nodes.

A Breadth-First Search is the process of searching entire row of Nodes before we proceed to the next. At the root Node, this requires searching up to two Nodes. As we descend to lower levels, the number of Nodes increases.

5. Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.

A) 
This is a graph with no structure. It doesn't form loops and there is no way to see the cost of travel between nodes. A start or an end location is ambiguous.

6. What kind of graph is a binary search tree?

A) A Binary Search Tree is directed, a-cyclic, and unweighted graph.

#### Programming Questions

For the following questions, describe in words how you could solve the problem and then do so. Use the depiction of the Binary Search Tree to refer to the examples.

1. Given a Binary Search Tree and a value, write a function that checks to see whether the value exists within the tree.

Example: The value 10 exists in the tree. The value 23 does not exist in the tree.

2. Given a Binary Search Tree and two nodes, n1 and n2, write a function that finds the distance between the two nodes.

Example: The distance between the nodes 4 and 10 is 4. The distance between the nodes 8 and 10 is 1. The distance between the nodes 1 and 14 is 4.
