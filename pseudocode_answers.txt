####Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A)Because it helps programmers to concentrate on developing algorithms. It also helps to describe larger processes in a shorter overview.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A) It will not run on your computer. It's meant for humans to read rather than machines.


####Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

COMPARE number 1 and number 2
  IF number1 > number2 THEN
    PRINT number 1
  ELSE
    PRINT number 2
  END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FOR i=1 to 100
  PRINT i
END FOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FIND specific entry in a phonebook
FOR key in object
  IF key === name
    PRINT name and a phone number
    RETURN true
  ELSE
    PRINT "This person doesn't exist in phoneBook"


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

```
function searchPhoneNumber(obj, name){
  for (var key in obj){
    if(key=== name){
      console.log(`${name}'s phone number is ${obj[key]}`);
      return true;
    }
  }
  console.log("This person doesn't exist in phoneBook");
}
```
